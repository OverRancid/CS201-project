Project Title : Segment Trees Data Structure
Summary: The primary objective of this project is to study Segment Trees and
implement them in C. Segment Tree is a very powerful and versatile data structure
used in computer science and mathematics for efficiently solving a wide range of
problems related to range-based queries and updates. It is designed to address
scenarios where one needs to perform operations on specific segments or intervals
of an array or data set. Segment trees are known for their ability to handle various
range-based queries, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or applying
custom functions to elements within a specified range.
